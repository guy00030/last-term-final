		<h2>About</h2>
		
			<p>Unique, vibrant, unusual – when you want quality fashionable clothing visit Vanilla now also located in Westboro.  Owner Cas Greenman has made her signature Elgin street store a destination for fashionistas for years. Now she brings her fashion philosophy to the Westboro location of Vanilla. Cas says, “Your clothes should be able to be worn many ways, dress up or down, mix well and last for years. A wardrobe should not only make you look and feel good but it should work hard and  suit your life. We have lots of brands from Europe the US and Canada, so if something isn’t wonderful on a customer, we can always find something better. We want you to love it” </p>
	
			<p>Colour is big at Vanilla  Clothing is  colour-blocked  making for sweeps of interesting colour combos to suggest possible outfits  and adding visually to the vibrancy of the store.‘Style through the ages’ is the theme with funky and evocative prints on the walls showing women in fabulous clothing from Pompeii to Klimt. The space is large and slightly industrial in feel with antiques, huge vintage light fixtures and global textiles. There’s even a central seating area for tired friends or waiting husbands.</p>
			
			<p>Canadian designed and made. Courtier trained,  Cas has high standards for textiles and quality of production. She designs a line of organic cotton tops in lots of colours and shapes in store year round, as well as other seasonal clothing, and a line of semi precious stone and silver jewellery all produced here in Ottawa Gatineau. </p>
